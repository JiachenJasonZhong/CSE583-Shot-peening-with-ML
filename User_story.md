The first set of users that may use this product would be individuals in the precision manufacturing space.  
They want to use this tool to see how wing spars and turbine blades hold up to shot peening and how shoulld they fit shot peened parts together
.who want a rapid and accurate method to see the effect of shot peening.
The user has a strong background in engineering but not necessarily software.


Emma is an Aerospace R&D Engineer. They want to predict the deformation results caused by shot peening in a relatively simple and precise way to improve the production of aerospace components. They gonna input the parameters of shot peening and the material's properties like the type, shape, and so on. They are usually good at aerospace and engineering but not good at machine learning and statistical forecasting.
